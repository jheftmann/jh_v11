## CSS Cleanup

### Remove Redundant Breakpoint Declarations
- [ ] Review and remove duplicate CSS declarations across breakpoints
- [ ] Consolidate shared styles into base mobile-first declarations
- [ ] Only keep breakpoint-specific overrides in media queries
- [ ] Focus on:
  - `.overlay-nav` positioning and width
  - `.nav` layout and alignment
  - `.nav-item` and `.nav-info` styles
  - Container and spacing adjustments
- [ ] Test all breakpoints after cleanup to ensure no regressions
