          Individuals and teams work with me on a one-off or recurring basis. Sessions take the format of problem identification and designing solutions. I can either guide teams through the solution phase or contribute directly to specific initiatives.

          From 2012-2025, I ran a widely recognized design studio in New York City working in branding and digital design for high-growth startups and industry leaders. The studio was acquired in 2020 where I continued as Creative Director, growing to 30 people across design and engineering.
